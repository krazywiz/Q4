My mod is titled "Leader of the Strogg" and has several aspects to it, the main goal being controlling the strogg.


Strogg Switch Teams:
The mod is built upon the idea of the strogg switching teams to join the player. This can be accomplished through a power(standing near a strogg) or weapon(the blaster)

Powers:
The player character has several powers, such as...

1- The strogg begin in a passive state, unable to move until the player releases them by crouching and turning on the flashlight at the same time.
2- If the player gets within a short distance of a strogg in passive state, it will switch to his team.
3- The player is immortal and cannot die. However, if his health dips below zero, nearby strogg will turn to stone.
4-Strog bodies no longer dissapear upon death. If the player crouches, nearby bodies are absorbed and he gains health.
5-If the player turns the flashlight on when a strogg is in passive state, then they develope a fiery spirit shield, rendering them undamagable. The player can then turn the flashlight off, turning the strogg into an immortal invisible phantom, or zoom in with a weapon, removing the strogg.
6-The player can have a strogg leave his team by zooming in with a weapon near it.

Stat Boosts:
If a player stands near a passive state strogg, the strogg will rapidly increase in health.


Weapon Mods:

1-The blaster: Strogg hit by it join the player's team
2-Machine gun: Can now rapid fire while zoomed in, to ensure that strogg you teamed up with can't rejoin you while you mow them down.
3-shotgun: Destroys any non-teamate in the player's line of sight.
4- Hyperblaster: hitting a strog with this causes it to become immortal and unkillable.
5-Rail Gun: Freezes a strog in place.
6- Nail Gun: Fires one nail at a time before reloading. Implants itself into a strig, instantly killing it, then growing a grunt instead.
7-Napalm Gun: Used to clear rooms. Radius and damage have been greatly increased, while player takes no damage from it.
8-Dark Matter Gun: No longer detonates on contact, nor does damage. It sucks in the corpses of strogg and piles them into a neat corner. Used for cleanup.
9-Grenade Launcher: Cures a strogg (kills it and spawns a marine in its place)
10- Lightning gun: Heals strogg.

UI changes: 
Many weapons now have unlimited ammo, which can be noted by the clearing of the number lables over the weapon symbol in the bottom left corner of the screen.
Many weapons now also bear a "-1" on their screen, to denote their strogg controlling abilities"
